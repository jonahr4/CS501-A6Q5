# Location Information (Q5)

Google Maps sample that centers on the user and surfaces nearby info.

- Requests location permission, recenters the map on the current position, and drops a marker there.
- Reverse-geocodes to show address details alongside the map.
- Tapping anywhere adds a custom marker so users can note spots of interest.
- Works in emulator with mocked location for testing.
